To get updates from your favorite YouTuber's videos in your RSS feed, you can follow these steps:

1. **Find the YouTube Channel's RSS Feed URL**:
   YouTube channels have a specific RSS feed format. The URL typically looks like this:
   
   ```
   https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
   ```

   To find the `CHANNEL_ID`, go to the YouTube channel page and look at the URL. The `CHANNEL_ID` is the string of characters after `channel/` in the URL.

2. **Use an RSS Reader**:
   Once you have the RSS feed URL, you need an RSS reader to subscribe to it. There are many RSS readers available, such as Feedly, Inoreader, or The Old Reader. 

3. **Add the RSS Feed**:
   - Open your RSS reader.
   - Look for an option to add a new feed or subscription.
   - Paste the YouTube RSS feed URL you obtained earlier.
   - Save or subscribe to the feed.

4. **Receive Updates**:
   After subscribing, your RSS reader will check the feed for new videos from the YouTuber, and you will receive updates whenever they upload new content.

By following these steps, you can easily keep track of your favorite YouTuber's video uploads through your RSS feed.
