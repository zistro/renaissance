> You need at least Python 2.5 or at most Python 2.7
  > Python 3 and PyPy are not yet supported.

> I use uGet [or pure wget, yt-dlp, etc], I used FDM, and I see that Motrix, XDM and pyLoad are highly recommended on the internet.
however, I believe that in functions all of them are poor compared to JDownloader.
they are all much simpler.

cheers!
